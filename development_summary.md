- Identified core functionalities: market data retrieval, analysis, and transaction capabilities
- Determined authentication approach and API structure
- Created comprehensive requirements documentation

### API Structure Design
- Designed the API structure based on the agent-next-boilerplate framework
- Organized endpoints into three main categories: market data, analysis, and transactions
- Defined request/response formats for all endpoints
- Created a detailed API design document

### OpenAPI Specification Implementation
- Implemented the OpenAPI specification in `src/app/api/ai-plugin/route.ts`
- Defined all endpoints, parameters, and response schemas
- Configured authentication and server information
- Ensured compatibility with the agent-next-boilerplate framework

### Market Data Endpoints Implementation
- Created endpoints for listing markets, retrieving specific markets, trending markets, and search
- Implemented proper error handling and parameter validation
- Added configuration helpers for API integration
- Ensured consistent response formatting

### Analysis Endpoints Implementation
- Created endpoints for market analysis, market comparison, and sentiment analysis
- Implemented data transformation for analysis results
- Added support for different timeframes
- Ensured proper error handling and validation

### Transaction Endpoints Implementation
- Created endpoints for bet placement, liquidity management, and transaction history
- Implemented request validation for transaction parameters
- Added authentication checks for secure operations
- Ensured consistent error handling and response formatting

### Documentation Creation
- Created comprehensive API documentation with detailed endpoint information
- Added user guide for interacting with the agent
- Included developer guide with project structure and extension instructions
- Added deployment guide for production setup

### Project Finalization
- Created README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- Added package.json with dependencies and scripts
- Ensured consistent project structure
- Verified all components are properly organized for delivery

## Deliverables
1. Complete source code for the Polymarket AI agent
2. Comprehensive documentation including API reference, user guide, and developer guide
3. README.md with setup and deployment instructions
4. Package.json with dependencies and scripts

## Future Enhancements
1. Enhanced market intelligence with deeper analysis of market correlations
2. More sophisticated natural language query parsing
3. Integration with external data sources for market analysis
4. Portfolio optimization suggestions
5. Real-time updates via WebSocket connections

## Conclusion
The Polymarket AI agent has been successfully implemented according to the requirements. It provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for interacting with Polymarket prediction markets, performing analysis, and executing transactions. The agent follows the architecture of the agent-next-boilerplate framework and is ready for deployment.

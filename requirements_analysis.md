# Polymarket AI Agent Requirements Analysis

## Project Overview
This document analyzes the requirements for developing an AI agent for Polymarket using the agent-next-boilerplate framework. The agent will enable users to fetch prediction market data, perform market analysis, and execute transactions on Polymarket.

## Technical Framework
- **Base Framework**: Next.js 15
- **Architecture**: Based on [agent-next-boilerplate](https://github.com/BitteProtocol/agent-next-boilerplate/tree/main/src/app/api/ai-plugin)
- **API Structure**: OpenAPI specification with dedicated endpoints for different functionalities

## Core Functionality Requirements

### 1. Data Fetching & Analysis
The agent must be able to retrieve and analyze various types of market data:

- **Current Market Data**:
  - Open markets listing with filtering capabilities
  - Current odds and probability calculations
  - Liquidity information for markets
  - Market details (resolution criteria, end date, etc.)

- **Historical Analysis**:
  - Past performance of markets
  - Price movement patterns
  - Volume trends over time

- **Market Discovery**:
  - Search functionality with natural language processing
  - Category-based browsing
  - Trending markets identification
  - Related markets suggestions

- **User Data** (if authentication implemented):
  - Current positions
  - Portfolio performance
  - Transaction history

### 2. Transaction Capabilities
The agent should enable users to execute various transactions:

- **Betting Operations**:
  - Place bets on specific outcomes
  - Calculate potential returns
  - Manage existing positions

- **Liquidity Management**:
  - Add liquidity to markets
  - Remove liquidity from positions
  - Calculate fees and returns from liquidity provision

- **Transaction Management**:
  - Check transaction status
  - View transaction history
  - Calculate profits/losses

### 3. Market Intelligence
The agent should provide intelligent insights:

- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Analyze market sentiment based on price movements
  - Identify unusual activity

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - Compare related markets
  - Identify correlations between markets

- **Opportunity Detection**:
  - Identify arbitrage opportunities
  - Highlight markets with significant recent movement
  - Detect mispriced outcomes

## Authentication Considerations

The preferred approach is to implement a solution that avoids API keys for simplicity. Options include:

1. **Public API Only**: Limit functionality to publicly available data (may restrict transaction capabilities)
2. **Proxy Authentication**: Handle authentication server-side to avoid exposing credentials
3. **User-Provided Credentials**: Allow users to provide their own API credentials if necessary
4. **OAuth Flow**: Implement a proper OAuth flow if Polymarket supports it

If API keys are required:
- Store securely using environment variables
- Implement proper credential management
- Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse

## API Structure Requirements

### OpenAPI Specification
The OpenAPI specification should be implemented in `src/app/api/ai-plugin/route.ts` and include:
- Comprehensive endpoint definitions
- Clear parameter specifications
- Proper response schemas
- Authentication requirements (if applicable)

### API Endpoints Organization
Endpoints should be organized in the `src/app/api/tools/polymarket/` directory by functionality:

1. **Market Data Endpoints**:
   - Markets listing with filtering
   - Individual market details
   - Trending markets
   - Search functionality

2. **Analysis Endpoints**:
   - Market analysis
   - Comparative analysis
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Historical performance

3. **Transaction Endpoints**:
   - Bet placement
   - Liquidity management
   - Transaction history
   - Position management

## Integration Requirements

### Polymarket API Integration
The agent will need to integrate with the Polymarket API:
- Identify available endpoints and their functionality
- Understand authentication requirements
- Handle rate limiting appropriately
- Implement error handling for API failures

### Real-time Updates
Consider implementing WebSocket connections for real-time market updates if supported by Polymarket.

## User Interaction Patterns

The agent should handle these conversation flows:

1. **Information Queries**:
   - Parse natural language queries about markets
   - Map queries to appropriate API endpoints
   - Return relevant data in conversational format

2. **Transaction Requests**:
   - Understand user intent for transactions
   - Confirm details before execution
   - Execute transactions via API
   - Provide confirmation and summary

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize API calls to minimize latency
- Consider batching requests where appropriate

### Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling for API failures
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### Security
- Secure handling of any credentials
- Validate user inputs
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Documentation Requirements
The project requires comprehensive documentation:
- API documentation generated from OpenAPI spec
- User guide explaining agent capabilities
- Developer documentation for code structure
- Deployment instructions

## Future Enhancement Possibilities
Potential areas for future improvement:
- Enhanced market intelligence with deeper analysis
- Improved natural language query processing
- Integration with external data sources
- Portfolio optimization suggestions
